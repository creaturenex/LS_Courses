## Enumerable Class Creation
Assume we have a `Tree` class that implements a binary tree.

```ruby
class Tree
  ...
end
```
A binary tree is just one of many forms of collections, such as Arrays, Hashes, Stacks, Sets, and more. All of these collection classes include the Enumerable module, which means they have access to an each method, as well as many other iterative methods such as `map, reduce, select`, and more.

For this exercise, modify the Tree class to support the methods of Enumerable. You do not have to actually implement any methods -- just show the methods that you must provide.

## Optional Blocks
Write a method that takes an optional block. If the block is specified, the method should execute it, and return the value returned by the block. If no block is specified, the method should simply return the String 'Does not compute.'.

```ruby
compute { 5 + 3 } == 8
compute { 'a' + 'b' } == 'ab'
compute == 'Does not compute.'
```

## Find Missing Numbers
Write a method that takes a sorted array of integers as an argument, and returns an array that includes all of the missing integers (in order) between the first and last elements of the argument.

```ruby
missing([-3, -2, 1, 5]) == [-1, 0, 2, 3, 4]
missing([1, 2, 3, 4]) == []
missing([1, 5]) == [2, 3, 4]
missing([6]) == []
```

## Divisors
Write a method that returns a list of all of the divisors of the positive integer passed in as an argument. The return value can be in any sequence you wish.

```ruby
divisors(1) == [1]
divisors(7) == [1, 7]
divisors(12) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
divisors(98) == [1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98]
divisors(99400891) == [1, 9967, 9973, 99400891]
# may take a minute
```

## Encrypted Pioneers
The following list contains the names of individuals who are pioneers in the field of computing or that have had a significant influence on the field. The names are in an encrypted form, though, using a simple (and incredibly weak) form of encryption called Rot13.

```ruby

## Iterators: True for Any?
A great way to learn about blocks is to implement some of the core ruby methods that use blocks using your own code. Over this exercise and the next several exercises, we will do this for a variety of different standard methods.

The Enumerable#any? method processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns a value of true for any element, then #any? returns true. Otherwise, #any? returns false. Note in particular that #any? will stop searching the collection the first time the block returns true.

Write a method called any? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns true for any of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns true.

If the Array is empty, any? should return false, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any standard ruby method that is named all?, any?, none?, or one?.
```ruby
any?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == true
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.even? } == false
any?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.odd? } == false
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == true
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == true
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == false
any?([]) { |value| true } == false
```

## Iterators: True for All?
In the previous exercise, you developed a method called any? that is similar to the standard Enumerable#any? method for Arrays (our actual solution works with any Enumerable collection). In this exercise, you will develop its companion, all?.

Enumerable#all? processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns a value of true for every element, then #all? returns true. Otherwise, #all? returns false. Note in particular that #all? will stop searching the collection the first time the block returns false.

Write a method called all? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns true for all of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns false.

If the Array is empty, all? should return true, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any standard ruby method that is named all?, any?, none?, or one?.
```ruby
all?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == false
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.odd? } == true
all?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.even? } == true
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == false
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == true
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == false
all?([]) { |value| false } == true
```

## Iterators: True for None?
In the previous two exercises, you developed methods called any? and all? that are similar to the standard Enumerable methods with the same names. In this exercise, you will develop another of the methods in this family, none?.

Enumerable#none? processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns true for any element, then #none? returns false. Otherwise, #none? returns true. Note in particular that #none? will stop searching the collection the first time the block returns true.

Write a method called none? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns false for all of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns true.

If the Array is empty, none? should return true, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any of the following methods from the Array and Enumerable classes: all?, any?, none?, one?. You may, however, use either of the methods created in the previous two exercises.

```ruby
none?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == false
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.even? } == true
none?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.odd? } == true
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == false
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == false
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == true
none?([]) { |value| true } == true
```

## Iterators: True for One?
In the previous 3 exercises, you developed methods called any?, all?, and none? that are similar to the standard Enumerable methods of the same names. In this exercise, you will develop one last method from this family, one?.

Enumerable#one? processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns a value of true for exactly one element, then #one? returns true. Otherwise, #one? returns false. Note in particular that #one? will stop searching the collection the second time the block returns true.

Write a method called one? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns true for exactly one of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns true a second time.

If the Array is empty, one? should return false, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any standard ruby method that is named all?, any?, none?, or one?.

```ruby
one?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? }    # -> true
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.odd? }     # -> false
one?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.even? }    # -> false
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } # -> true
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true }           # -> false
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false }          # -> false
one?([]) { |value| true }                     # -> false
```

## Count Items
Write a method that takes an array as an argument, and a block that returns true or false depending on the value of the array element passed to it. The method should return a count of the number of times the block returns true.

You may not use Array#count or Enumerable#count in your solution.
```ruby
Copy Code
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| value.odd? } == 3
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| value % 3 == 1 } == 2
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| true } == 5
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| false } == 0
count([]) { |value| value.even? } == 0
count(%w(Four score and seven)) { |value| value.size == 5 } == 2
```
