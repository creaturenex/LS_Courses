Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and return all the possible consecutive number series of a specified length in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

012
123
234
Likewise, here are the 4-digit series:

0123
1234
Finally, if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you should throw an error.

Problem
take a string of consecutive digits and return consecutive number series based on the specified length

Examples
- see tests
- "01234" has the following 3-digit series:
  - 012
  - 123
  - 234
- Likewise, here are the 4-digit series:
  - 0123
  - 1234

Data
- Input - string of num

- Output - an array of integers each sub array is the size of the specificfied slice, each element in the sub array is a integer
