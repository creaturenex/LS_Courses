Sum of Multiples

Write a program that, given a natural number and a set of one or more other numbers, can find the sum of all the multiples of the numbers in the set that are less than the first number. If the set of numbers is not given, use a default set of 3 and 5.

For instance, if we list all the natural numbers up to, but not including, 20 that are multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18. The sum of these multiples is 78.

P:roblem
Give a natural number and a set onf one or more numbers
return the sum of all the multiples of the number in the set that are less than the first natural number

if a second set of number is not provided use the default set of 3 and 5

E:xamples
- see tests
- For instance, if we list all the natural numbers up to, but not including, 20 that are multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18. The sum of these multiples is 78.

- #to is a class method

new instance accepts a parameter to defined which the multiples are, if no muliple are give 3 and 5 are the default
