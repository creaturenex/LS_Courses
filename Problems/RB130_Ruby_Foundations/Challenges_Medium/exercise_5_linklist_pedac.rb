Simple Linked List

Write a simple linked list implementation. The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.

The simplest kind of linked list is a singly linked list. Each element in the list contains data and a "next" field pointing to the next element in the list of elements. This variant of linked lists is often used to represent sequences or push-down stacks (also called a LIFO stack; Last In, First Out).

Let's create a singly linked list whose elements may contain a range of data such as the numbers 1-10. Provide functions to reverse the linked list and convert a linked list to and from an array.

PROBLEM
create a link list, who elements may contain a range of data,
provide functions to reverse the list
convert linked list to array and the reverse ie array to link list


EXAMPLES
- see test

DATA
- Input
- Output

ALGORITHM - how to solve this?

create link class
create reverse method
create to_a method
create to_l method

CODE
- see file
