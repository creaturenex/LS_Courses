Robot Name
Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name. The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while, we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random; they should not follow a predictable sequence. Random names means there is a risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow the use of the same name twice when avoidable.

Problem
- Generate a random name, ie must be random, if factory reset is selected then a new name is generated that does not match original

Example
- see test

Data
- Input N/A

- Output string with two letter and 3 numbers

Algorithm - how would I solve this or what do I need to know
first each name must be different

I can pick

Code
- see file
