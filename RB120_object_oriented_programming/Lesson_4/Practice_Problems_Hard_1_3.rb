# Practice Problems: Hard 1_3

# Question 3

# Building on the prior vehicles question, we now must also track a basic motorboat. A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves similar to a catamaran. Therefore, creators of Motorboat instances don't need to specify number of hulls or propellers. How would you modify the vehicles code to incorporate a new Motorboat class?

# Solution 3
module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Moveable

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Catamaran
  include Moveable
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity

    # ... other code to track catamaran-specific data omitted ...
  end
end

class Motorboat
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers # Attr_reader only allows @variable access
    @hull_count = num_hulls # if attr_writer was here then self.hull_count = would work
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity

    # ... other code to track catamaran-specific data omitted ...
  end
